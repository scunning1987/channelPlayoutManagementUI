![](readme_images/workshop-arc1.png?width=35pc&classes=border,shadow)

## Setup Instructions for the **Instructor's Account**
Services to deploy and configure:

* IAM
* Amazon S3
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon API Gateway
* Amazon EC2

*Optionally, the instructor can also deploy the services that will feature in the workshop (instructions for setting up these items are featured in this instruction manual):*

* AWS Elemental MediaLive
* AWS Elemental MediaPackage
* AWS Elemental MediaConnect

---
### IAM
---

The instructor will need to:

1. Create an IAM role for AWS Lambda, including policies for local service access as well as trainee account access

1. Create an IAM role for MediaLive (optional if the instructor is deploying the solution on this account)

1. Create an IAM role for MediaConnect (optional if the instructor is deploying the solution on this account)

#### AWS Lambda Role
1. In the IAM Console, select **Roles** from the navigation pane and then the 'Create Role' button

2. Under 'Trusted entity', select **AWS Service**, then select 'Lambda' from the available services displayed. Click **Next: Permissions** 

3. Search for 'S3ReadOnlyAccess', tick the box to the left of the result to add this policy to the role. Then clear the search box and search for 'AmazonAPIGatewayInvokeFullAccess', tick the box to the left of the result, then select **Create Policy**, this will open a new tab to create a custom policy.

4. Under **Service**, search for and select 'MediaLive', under **Actions** select 'All MediaLive Actions'. Under **Resources** select 'All resources', then select **Review Policy**

![](readme_images/iam1.png)

5. Call the policy 'MediaLiveFullAccess', then select **Create policy**

6. Go back to the Create role tab in your browser, select the refresh button and then tick the box to the left of the result

![](readme_images/iam2.png)

7. Click on **Next: Tags**

8. Click on **Next: Review**

9. In the **Role name** field, enter 'AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML'

10. Select **Create role**

11. Whilst still in the **Roles** section of IAM, search for the role just created 'AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML' - click on the result to go into the role configuration

![](readme_images/iam12.png)

12. In the Permissions tab, select **Add inline policy**

![](readme_images/iam13.png)

13. Select the JSON tab, then paste the below policy. *Replace the account numbers (ie. 111111111111) with the trainee account number(s)*

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML",
            "arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML",
            "arn:aws:iam::333333333333:role/AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML"
        ]
    }
}
```

**IMPORTANT: The role specified in this inline policy, 'AWSLambdaAccessToS3AndEML', will need to be created in each of the trainee accounts. See the section 'Setup Instructions for the Trainees's Account' at the end of this document for more details**

#### MediaLive Role

The best way to create a MediaLive role with the right policies is to first get MediaLive to create a role automatically. We will then go and edit the role to contain what we need.

1. In the AWS console, search for MediaLive and select the result to go to the MediaLive Console.

1. Click on **Create Channel**, don't worry, we're not actually going to create the channel 

![](readme_images/iam3.png)

3. Under **Create Channel**, click on **Channel and input details**

3. Click on **Create role from template**, then the **Create IAM role** button

![](readme_images/iam4.png)

5. You will see a role has been successfully created

![](readme_images/iam5.png)

6. Don't go any further in the channel configuration, instead, navigate to the IAM console.

6. Go to the **Roles** section and search for the role that MediaLive just created, it should be called 'MediaLiveAccessRole'. Click on the returned result.

![](readme_images/iam6.png)

8. In the Permissions tab, click on the **MediaLiveCustomPolicy**, then select the **Edit Policy** button.

![](readme_images/iam7.png)

9. In the Policy editor, select the **JSON** tab, then paste the contents of the below json block into the editor.

![](readme_images/iam8.png)

Policy json code block:

| 172.1.2.3    | ec2-52-24-130-125.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com |

*Note: If you turn off your instance and then turn it back on, it will be assigned a new Public IPv4 and DNS address. The private IP address does not change, however.*

After a few minutes you can validate that the server had all its applications installed successfully by trying to load the UI in your browser:

http://[Public DNS or IPv4 IP]/mcr/softpanel.html

Example:
http://ec2-52-24-130-125.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/mcr/softpanel.html

#### EC2 Server Configuration with API Endpoints
For simplicity, a configuration dashboard is available for you to enter your target URL's, including API Gateway endpoint, and HLS endpoint.

Using your EC2's public IP or FQDN, navigate to this page in your browser (replace the IP below with your public address):

http://12.23.34.45/`dashboard-master.html`

Enter the following information: 

* EC2 IP : example : 12.23.34.45 (enter the IP address only)

* HLS URL : example : http://mediapackage.net/index.m3u8 (get this information from your MediaPackage endpoint or CloudFront distribution)

* API URL : example : https://myapigateway.net/eng (get this information from your API Gateway endpoint in the API Gateway console, in the 'eng' stage section)

![](readme_images/ecc7.png)

Click the **Update All** button once you've filled out all of the details

*Note: you will need to refresh your browser for any of these changes to take effect on your dashboard page, and you may even require a cache clear*
